We were welcomed by Vanessa, the local Eurasia lecturer.  She introduced us to our workshop with a brief history of Xi’an. She explained its evolution as an ancient city, once the capital of China during the Western Zhou, Western Han, Sui, Northern Zhou, and Tang imperial dynasties. A fascinating point mentioned in this lecture was the Feng Shui in Xi’an’s development. The city’s location was carefully chosen for its optimal natural surroundings, which protected it from extreme weather and ensured mild temperatures year-round, making it an ideal settlement in ancient times. This introduction to Xi’an’s history was not only engaging but also essential for understanding the context of the project we were about to undertake.', 'After this lecture, we were introduced to the Chinese students and given time to explore the campus. The lines of shops, wide roads, numerous scooters, massive sports fields, and rows of pine & ginkgo trees were impressive. I was deeply grateful for the chance to experience this environment as a student. While I’ve traveled overseas for holidays and family visits, experiencing a place as a student felt entirely different.')" id="day-one">

These included the former residence of Gao Yue Song, the Muslim Quarter, the Great Mosque, the Old Residential Area, and the Museum. The historical former residence of Gao Yue Song provided insight into the living conditions and family dynamics of the old noble class. The building’s extensive restoration over time reflected its cultural importance.', 'Xi’an is home to a Muslim minority, and the Muslim quarter is a place where many live to be close to the Great Mosque, an ancient and culturally significant complex. Vanessa shared insights from her own studies, explaining how this small community has evolved over time. She highlighted the changing habits of worship across generations and how these shifts influence their daily lives. We were given time to explore the area, and try out signature foods, such as Biang Biang noodles and Chinese style hotpot. During my exploration of this area, I got comfortable with using Alipay and weChat pay - alternatives to using credit cards, which are not available in China. As a Digital Design student, I found these systems fascinating, especially in comparison to platforms I’ve used or studied in the West. WeChat’s extensive range of functions stood out to me. While such extensive multifunctionality is often discouraged in Western app design, its effectiveness and popularity in China seem to prove its practicality.')" id="day-two">

We learned about current practices and nuances within small, low socio-economic Chinese communities, as well as the follow the thing/person concept—a framework for examining a particular object or person and the network of interactions surrounding them. An interesting point discussed in Vanessa’s lecture was the unique relationship that some Chinese people have with public and private space, and how over time these spaces change to best suit the needs/wants of residents and stakeholders. This touched on things like the benefits and downfalls of tourism, urbanisation and municipal changes ', 'We had the opportunity to speak with a community leader of the district, who shared insights with us on current sustainability and social community initiatives. My group chose to focus on food sustainability practices in the area and explore how food waste is managed. We learned about a program called “Little Dining Table,” run by a mothers’ group. Through this initiative, mothers prepare dinners for children from local schools, providing them with a small income while fostering community engagement.')" id="day-three">

We investigated food disposal sites and examined the food management habits of the locals. One key finding was that the district outsourced 100% of its food from other districts, as it lacked food markets of its own. Due to the high population density, community gardens were only feasible within schools and served primarily educational purposes rather than as a supplemental food source. Despite this, the gardens were valuable to the community, so we explored ways to expand their impact by teaching schoolchildren how to manage their food waste more effectively.', 'We also researched methods for food waste management that could be implemented on a larger scale, such as diverting food waste to biomass incinerators instead of regular incinerators, creating a renewable energy source. In addition to this, we analysed the Eurasia campus food management system to identify effective practices that could be adapted to the Jie Fang district. We found that Chinese food sorting systems were much stricter than Australian ones, with multiple bins being sorted by workers whose jobs focused on managing waste on campus. ')"id="day-four">

We received guidance from our team leader Jen and our lecturer Vanessa on how to move forward with our project. Since our project encompassed multiple solutions, they suggested shifting from a linear study to a branching approach. This led us to create an infographic that illustrated different research paths while emphasising the connections between our ideas.', 'After the presentation we focused on creating an infographic for the exhibition. We created several maps, diagrams and image collages to communicate our ideas as simply & visually as possible. OAt a later stage, we revised the infographic to include improved imagery for a more engaging and eye-catching display. This project provided me with deep insights into food waste practices in the Jie Fang District and on a global scale. I felt that it pushed me to utilise skills beyond digital, such as interviewing, mapmaking, sustainability-driven design thinking, infographic creation, and cross-language communication.')" id="day-five">

We had the opportunity to present our findings and reflect upon our experiences. As part of the closing, we exchanged parting gifts with the Chinese students. Although our time together was short, saying goodbye was difficult as they had become good friends and incredibly supportive hosts.', 'Overall, I felt that this workshop was an incredibly valuable experience. Working within such a short timeframe with students from different disciplines who spoke a different language challenged me to reflect on my communication skills and find more effective ways to express my ideas and understand others. Together, we overcame many obstacles, and I felt proud of the final result we achieved as a team.')" id="day-six">

The Terracotta Museum and archaeological pits were particularly impressive, offering a fascinating look into the legacy of Qinshihuang, and the Great Chinese Empire.The wild goose pagoda was beautiful and unique in its architecture, highlighting the ancient Indian influence of the structure. This added a layer of insight into the diversity of Xi’an during ancient times, as it was a key point on the Silk Road and a major capital city. Overall, This study tour was a valuable opportunity that deepened my understanding of cultural and sustainability issues, whilst improving my ability to collaborate across disciplines and languages. The sprint-like schedule helped me adapt quickly and think critically under pressure. The tour was also an incredible opportunity to explore Chinese culture in an authentic way and connect with local communities.', 'In terms of sustainability attitudes in Xi’an, I found many differences to Perth perspectives, from the way food waste was managed (with 3+ bins for different types of waste), the dedication to having jobs on campus commited to sorting food waste, and the use of biodegradable products. I noticed that biodegradable packaging was much more common then Australia, where it’s common to have some packaging unavailable or cost money. Both methods effectively reduce pollution, but it’s interesting that different approaches have been taken. Considering Xi’an has such a high population in comparison to Perth, it makes sense that they would need a stricter waste sorting system to manage the amount of waste that is produced. I also noticed a higher prevalence of electric cars in Xi’an, which are less pollutant in comparison to regular cars, which may help air quality- as Xi’an is a massive city. Therefore, it is more prone to air pollution, which isn’t currently an issue in Perth.')" id="day-seven">
